## Hello!
### 🤗 I'm Dora Lee (@dsa28s), a 25 year old developer who wants to be as versatile as Doraemon!

### 👨‍💻 I'm currently working at [ModHaus](https://www.mod-haus.com/) as an
- Android Engineer (and Frontend Engineer) at [ModHaus](https://www.mod-haus.com/)!
- My main focus is [Android](https://developers.android.com), and I occasionally dabble in [iOS](https://developers.apple.com) and [Kotlin Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html) as a hobby!

### 😘 There are so many things I want to do, so after work I usually work on my
- side projects after work!
- I enjoy drinking 🍻 beer, reading books, and catching up on YouTube.
- I love to eat so much that I often go on restaurant hunts!

### 📚 Currently, I'm studying
- I'm learning Kotlin Native.
- I'm trying to create my own interpreter language with rust.

### 👋 We talk together, we project together!

I love meeting new people, chatting with them, and working on projects together!
